# Recurrence Based Complexity Explanation
# Recursive Binary Search
# -------------------------------------------------------
# In recursive binary search, at each step:
# - We divide the array into two halves.
# - We continue searching only in one half.
# - One comparison is performed at each step.
# If the size of the array is n,
# after one recursive call the size becomes n/2.
# Therefore, the recurrence relation is:
# T(n) = T(n/2) + 1
# Explanation:
# T(n/2)  -> time taken to solve smaller subproblem
# +1      -> time for comparison at current step
# Now solving the recurrence:
# After 1 step:
# T(n) = T(n/2) + 1
# After 2 steps:
# T(n) = T(n/4) + 2
# After 3 steps:
# T(n) = T(n/8) + 3
# After k steps:
# T(n) = T(n / 2^k) + k
# Recursion stops when:# n / 2^k = 1
# So,
# n = 2^k
# Taking log on both sides:# k = log2(n)
# Therefore,
# T(n) = O(log n)
# Time Complexity: O(log n)
# Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion stack)
